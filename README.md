# WJSlider
LeftSlider,Swift,lightweight,Not Object,Is Port. Not any more

You know how to use it when you open this project! 

Just let the parentcontroller confrom to the protocol "WJLeftSlider", 
then write code only one line! 
parentcontroller.setupLeftController(the left controller).
bingo!

Maybe i will add the right/top/bottom slider. You can also add them by yourself.
Just Add some Swipe Gesture with their Directrions to do the open/close Function.
After All,it's so easy! I believe you can add them .
